💰 Expense Tracker (Java)

A simple and efficient Expense Tracker application built using Java.
This project helps users record and manage their daily expenses by storing the expense name and amount, using core Java programming concepts.

📌 Project Overview

The Expense Tracker is a console-based Java application designed to demonstrate the practical use of:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Control flow statements

User input handling

It is ideal for beginners who want to understand how real-world problems can be solved using Java classes, methods, and logic structures.

🚀 Features

➕ Add expense with name and amount

📋 Display all recorded expenses

🧮 Calculate total expenses

🔄 Menu-driven program using switch-case

🧱 Clean code structure using classes and methods

❌ Exit option for smooth program termination

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Java

Concepts Applied:

Classes & Objects

Methods & Functions

Switch-Case Statements

Loops

Scanner for user input

Basic data handling

⚙️ How It Works

User selects an option from the menu.

Inputs expense name and amount.

Data is stored using class objects.

Program performs operations based on user choice.

Switch-case controls the application flow.
